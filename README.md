# Hello World! 👋
I’m a Senior Software Engineer who truly enjoy building full-stack applications, always respecting the MVP concept to delivery results ASAP but always keeping in mind future improvements. At this moment I'm working with **React Native** and **React** to create mobile and web apps, and I’ve also built backends using tools like **Node.js**, **Express** and **Prisma**. I’ve worked on projects in areas like **banking**, **real estate** and **health care**, taking them from the first idea all the way to launching them on production independently, including the App Store and Google Play Store.

### What I Do 🚀
- Build apps from start to finish, ensuring they meet user and business needs.

- Create cross-platform mobile apps with React Native, Expo, and EAS CLI.

- Develop responsive web apps using React.js, Next.js, and TypeScript.

- Work on backends with Node.js, Express, and Prisma.

### Tools I Use 🛠️
- **Frontend:** React Native, React.js, Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Reanimated, Shadcn

- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, Prisma, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Websockets, GraphQL

- **DevOps:** GitHub Actions, CI/CD, Firebase, Azure, Vercel

- **Code Quality:** Clean Architecture, Design Patterns, SonarQube

### What Makes Me Different 🎯
- 5+ years of consecutive remote work experience, staying organized, independent and productive.

- Focused on clean, maintainable code that delivers results on time. No "I am a perfectionism" excuses to justify delays.

- Always learning and exploring new technologies. I'm a problem solver, meaning that I can work with any tool given to me.
